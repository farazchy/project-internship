Data Analysis & Visualization:

The project leverages dimensional modeling to create a data warehouse containing supplementary dimension data such as:

Airport information (name, code, location).
City data (city name, code, latitude/longitude).
Airline information (country, alliance).
Aircraft model and manufacturer details.

Visualization Analysis
Perform analysis across multiple dimensions such as price, duration, and location.
Visualize key data points on interactive maps, helping users make informed decisions.
Display dynamic price trend charts to show historical price fluctuations.

AI-Powered Recommendations
The project utilizes ChatGPT to offer personalized flight recommendations and insights based on user input. By analyzing historical and real-time data, the chatbot provides:

Price Predictions: When the best time to book tickets is based on seasonal trends and demand.
Optimized Routes: Suggests cost-effective flight routes and multi-stop combinations.
Dynamic Recommendations: Based on user preferences, the chatbot can dynamically recommend the best flight options.

Route Optimization
The flight route optimization system is built on a graph-based model where airports are nodes and flight connections are weighted edges. The model optimizes routes by considering:

Cost: Finding cheaper alternatives to direct flights.
Layover Time: Minimizing layover durations for a more efficient journey.
Travel Duration: Optimizing overall travel time by suggesting the quickest routes.
Airline Alliances: Considering airline partnerships to reduce costs and provide more seamless travel experiences.


Website & Chatbot:

The website serves as the main user interface for the project. It allows users to interact with various features such as searching for flights, viewing flight prices, and getting personalized recommendations.

Website Features:
Search Interface: Allows users to search for flights by specifying departure and destination airports, travel dates, and preferences.
Flight Results: Displays available flights with detailed information, including price, duration, and airline.
Flight Route Map: An interactive map to visualize flight routes and travel paths.
Price Trend Insights: Graphs that show historical price trends to help users make informed decisions about when to book flights.
